<!--
What is this?
It is a simple search tool that can be integrated in some web application that you are developing, 
it retrieves data from a list, this list can be of course updated with some SQL code within a Web Framework,
or other sources.

Example:
In its default state, the list was developed to work as a mention tool system, therefore users are retrieved from
an external SQL query (Not integrated in the code).
Since data is retrieved into a list, accessible from the inspect tools, with a 
document.getElementById() it is a good idea to just take this example as a good start for 
a more complex search tool, it is good within locale testing, in a deployement environment perhaps 
needs some more fixing, though so far it works well.
The to do list for now is the following:
1)Numbers are not allowed , not yet done
2)Special characters are not allowed in the input field, note yet done
3)Improve the list result.
4)When user enters *, the full result list will be displayed.

How to use it?
Just copy the files into your project, and create a call for it; If you just want to give a look at it, just
copy it in your project, even an empty folders, start the html file, and run in the inspect tools
open_search()
