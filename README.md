# web-development
This repository contains a bunch of tools I developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in my leisure time, some may be "simplification" of bigger projects that I keep undisclosed.

Feel free to use these codes, as I am not exploiting them, though it would be kind if you can mention my github page.
