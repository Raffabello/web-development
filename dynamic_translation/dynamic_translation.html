What is it?
I would suggest this code snippet for beginners, that are trying to build a simple website, but that offers an easy translation system, that is user friendly and
will surely make your website distinguish.

Copy the JS script in your source file, and adapt it for the elements you are planning to translate, when the user hovers with the mouse on the text,
the text will be pushed down, then will be translated, and returns to its position, in a very smooth way (You can check the example.mov), text is not selectable.

You may realize that this would take a tower of "if" conditionals, because this code can translate only elements that have inside "Hello World", and that have a specific
ID, I did not extend this code, because I am busy with other projects, but from here we can build a very extended and portable JS code, that can work in a good Web
Platform, from small to big project, such as gettext for Python.
